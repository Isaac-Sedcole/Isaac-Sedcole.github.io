      The time I got blocked on a simple problem.

      The problem was when we had to make an object within an object and then access some of the data within the inner most object.

      The problem solving technique I used was mainly just trying something. This proved to be a bit of an ineffective method as it didn't help me to get anywhere fast and ended up confusing myself a bit. Once I decided that was enough I switched to googling the issue and found some answers to my questions quickly.

      I learnt that just trying something, unless you are familiar with it and are confident in your understanding is probably not the best method to use as had I googled it from the very begining of when I started to get stuck then I would have completed the question much earlier and not caused myself so much of a headache and confusion.

      The time I solved a problem in an elegant way.

      The problem was when I had to remove the buzz words from a sentence in order to form the full grammatically correct sentence saying something. 

      The problem solving technique I used was pseudocoding, followed by console logging and finally followed by googling. 

      I learnt that pseudocoding is very useful for setting the structure of your code up and console logging can help you confirm or find out what the output of something is. And googling is most effective when you have hit a roadblock and are hard stuck on a question or problem.

      How confident do I feel using:
      - Pseudocode: Very confident, I found using this method very helpful.
      - Trying something: confident enough, as long as I have a vague idea of what I should be trying to do.
      - Rubber ducky method: This one makes you feel insane but is actually really useful, I am confident that this is a good problem solving technique.
      - Reading error messages: This one can be a little tricky depending on what the error message is, but I can see and sorta figure out what is going wrong mostly with these.
      - Console.logging: This was another very helpful method, I used this a lot to just confirm the output that I thought I was/should be getting.
      - Googling: This one had to be the biggest help when stuck. I never started with this method but without fail if there was something that blocked me or if I needed to know something then this was the go to method.
      - Asking your peers for help: I didn't actually use this method and am usually not too comfortable with it unless I am friends with said person.
      - Asking coaches for help: This would have been the step to go to if I thought that google couldn't help me. Thankfully I never got to that point and so didn't need to use it.
      - Improving your process with reflection: I didn't do a proper reflection that was written out but simply a mental note of "oh so thats how you do that", type sort of thing.
