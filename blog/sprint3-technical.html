  <h2></em>What are Margins?</em> </h2>
  <p> 
    An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
    - HTML is like the base information for the page with no special formatting or styling. It is similar to the base of a cake. while CSS does all the formatting and makes it look pretty. Essentially equivalent to the icing and decoration of a cake.
    Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).
    - Flow control is like How you make a cup of Tea, you always follow the same routine, boil the jug, get your tea bag, combine the hot water and tea, add a bit of milk, then drink.
    - A loop in real life would be like how the days of the week work, you go monday through to sunday, and then it repeats again infinitely.
    Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    - The DOM is a logical structure of documents. Everything that makes up your DOM is known as nodes. Nodes can be elements, attributes, text content, comments, document related stuff and various others.
    Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    - Objects are a data type that can be used to store a collection of data. Arrays are a variable that can be used to store a list of values.
    - you can access an array by using keywords such as push,pull etc. while an object you need to reach the layer of information within the object to access it
    Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
    - A function is a block of code that is used to perform an action. e.g. a function to add two numbers together. They are useful because they can be used to help shorten code when you might need to use something more than once and for complexity sake.
