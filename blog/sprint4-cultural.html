    <h2><div>Neuroplasticity</div></h2>

    <div> Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</div>
    By letting people know how neuroplasticity works, people can gain the benefits of knowing that you don’t have to be sorted into two separate piles of people, one group who are smart and one group who aren’t. You are able to all become smart through learning and reinforcing the learning to make it permanent through practise.
    <div>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</div>
    By making sure I re-use the connections I build by putting in some effort everyday into coding I can help strengthen my neural pathways instead of having my brain shave them down. Aka using repetition to avoid losing the abilities that I have learnt. I can also use my young age to help with developing new pathways as the younger you are the easier it is for you to develop through having more neuroplasticity.
    <div>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</div>
    Making sure to use it or lose it, if you want something to stick you have to make sure that you don't just completely stop using it. Repetition is an important one for helping to strengthen the neuroplasticity of your brain for the specific actions that you want. Making sure what you are doing specifically relates to what you are trying to achieve or progress on, e.g. if you are wanting to learn more about javascript then make sure to actually do javascript related things as opposed to a different programming language or something else all together.

    <h2><div>Growth Mindset</div></h2>
     
    <div>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</div>
    A growth mindset is the belief that you are in control of your own ability and can improve and learn. A growth mindset is relevant because it can and does help you to achieve in life. Having the belief that you are in control of your destiny will help you to strive towards what you want more than believing everything is already fixed and you can’t do anything to change it.
    <div>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</div>
    It surprised me how much of a difference exactly it made when you had a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset. I realised before taking this course something similar to what they show where you will be more willing to work hard if you believe you are the key to your future but I didn’t realise to what extent that was.
    <div>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</div>
    I initially did not believe myself to be a good programmer, larger from comparing myself to everyone that was doing really well at uni, and from then dropping out of uni. However I do believe through watching one of my friends who gave up on software engineering in their first year who now is working really hard to get himself into that tech space, that I can become what I want which is in this case a good programmer. I will make sure that I can tell myself to be more open and try again instead of shutting myself down and saying that I am not a good programmer.
