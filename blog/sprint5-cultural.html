    Core Skills
    What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    That I have the ability to become a programmer, I have learnt about my own weaknesses and how to overcome them, and that I can find it difficult to ask for help when I need it.
    What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
    Values role in programming is essentially what that person values in their coding. For example, some people may code for efficiency, or code for meeting a deadline, or code for readability. All that changes between these people are their values which shows the role they play in programming. Empathy and self awareness are important for when you are giving and receiving feedback to do with programming. If you are not empathetic with someone while giving feedback you may come across too harsh but if you do not have enough self awareness you may disregard any feedback you get even if it is good feedback for you to improve on.
    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    The most surprising part about core learning was how helpful it was to reflect inwards and especially how useful headspace was with setting a proper routine and just practising mindfulness.
    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    The most challenging aspect was definitely the introspection. It is always a difficult task to look inwards and really think.
    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
    Because programmers are people too, and if you start teaching them from the core about just how to be functional people then all other areas of their life will benefit, this includes but isn’t limited to programming.
    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
    It doesn’t feel like a waste of time. I think this because it has helped to teach me about myself more and allowed a deeper understanding of how to combat issues that can come up in general. This can help in many ways such as preparing for entering the industry and general communication with people as well as helping you identify and fix any weaknesses and strengthen any strengths you find.
     
     
    Learning reflection
    What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
    What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?
    My long term goal/career path is to become a good programmer. I don't specifically want to work for any company in particular I just want to work in the industry and build up experience and knowledge. I am hoping that the skills this course teaches me will help me land a job within the programming industry and I would love to help build something that helps people with their lives.
    What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
    Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?
    One of my biggest strengths coming into bootcamp will be my ability to pick things up quickly, with a some background knowledge of programming. A limitation will be concentrating for long periods of time. I tend to not be able to concentrate for long without needing to walk around and readjust. These are largely the same things I came into this course with. Being able to pick things up quickly is always a useful strength, this hopefully means that I am able to keep up with the content adequately. Having low amounts of time that I am able to concentrate with could potentially hinder me quite a bit, however because of the learning environment that I will be surrounded in, this will hopefully be a small issue as it will direct me back to where my focus should be.
    What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
    While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider here. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.
    Speaking in front of a group could definitely prove to be a struggle however I know that I will be able to do it. In general meeting people and feeling comfortable in that environment might be the biggest non-technical challenge that I will face at bootcamp.
    What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
    At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?
    For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self awareness and reflective skills.
    I would like to develop my ability to communicate with people effectively while at bootcamp at EDA. It would also be good for me to further improve on my reflective skills during the course.
    What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
    Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?
    Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
    My expectations of myself at bootcamp is that I do alright. I don’t want to get cocky and say i’ll do well but I really want to make sure to push myself to try and aim to do well. The main way I will seek help will be through my support network at home when it comes to non-technical help. The commitment that I will make towards managing my workload throughout bootcamp is that I will turn up on time, every weekday and put my full attention towards this course for the duration of those 9 weeks. I will make sure to reflect on myself and attempt to push myself out of my comfort zone with talking to others in order to get the most out of the experience.
