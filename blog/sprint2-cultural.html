<div class="small-text">- Long term goal and/or career pathway?</div>
My long term goal is to gain a job working in the tech industry as some sort of a developer. Whether that is a web dev or some other dev yet, I am unsure but I know that, that is where I want to be working. I hope that it will allow me to start a career that will be challenging and fresh while at the same time having job security and providing financial security too. I hope to help benefit the world, even if only in a small way.
<div class="small-text">- What skills (human skills not tech skills) would you like to see developed while at EDA?</div>
I think that some of my communication and peoples skills could use some developing as I can be a bit shy and awkward sometimes and so I hope that dev academy can help me grow in those two areas as well.
<div class="small-text">- Describe my strengths and limitations.</div>
A strength I have coming into this course is that I already have some knowledge of another programming language (Java) so I feel like I am in a position where for some parts of the foundations course could be easier for me than for someone who is brand new to programming. This also means I am working ahead of schedule which leads to a less stressful time. I can be very easily distracted sometimes. This is especially true if I am working from home and have every distraction known at just a fingertips length away from me.
<div class="small-text">- Based on my strengths and limitations, make a commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.</div>
Due to my strength of having some prior knowledge of programming and it leading to me being able to work ahead of schedule I want to allow myself more time for the later projects as they will take more of my time. As such I will try to commit to completing sprints up to 4, 1 week earlier than they are due. I will also commit to trying my best to avoid the distractions for certain periods of the day when I can be most productive, which is usually in the mornings. 
<div class="small-text">- A commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely manner.</div>
My first port of call for any sort of trouble with programming specifically is to go to google and try to find the answer there. If after I have spent some time looking and cannot find out what I want, I will then post my question in the EDA slack channels for some help from peers. If that then doesnâ€™t work I will proceed to specifically ask my course facilitator about the issue I am having.
<div class="small-text">- What I expect from the facilitation team.</div>
My expectations for the facilitation team is that they are there for me if I do need them (within working hours) whether it be to discuss some code and get some insight there, or even just to chat about things that might be going on in life that could be affecting my studies at EDA.
