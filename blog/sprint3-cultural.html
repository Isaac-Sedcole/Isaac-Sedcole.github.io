  <p> What is Emotional Intelligence?
    Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict.
    How is it different to IQ?
    IQ is known as “Intelligence Quotient” and it's a measure of a person's relative intelligence. Emotional Quotient, also known as EQ, is the ability to identify and manage your emotions and the emotions of others.

    By improving your EQ and taking active steps to make changes, you'll find you are more productive and can build more productive relationships around you. Emotional Intelligence is important, it's intrinsic to who we are, and as such it impacts every facet of our lives, and most notably the workplace.
