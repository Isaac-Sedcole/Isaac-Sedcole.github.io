  <h2></em>What are Margins?</em> </h2>
  <p> Margins are the outmost space used in CSS. Margins are used to create space around elements/content, outside of borders. 
    You can individually change the properties for each side of the margin for an element.
    e.g. the top, right, bottom, and left borders which can look like this when changed:
    <div style="margin-top: 20%;">this is a 20% margin from the top </div> <div style="margin-left: 50%;">while this is a 50% margin from the left</div> 
  </p>
  <h2>What are Borders</h2>
  <p> Borders are the inbetween the margin and padding. Borders again go around elements to create a border sort of style. 
    They can have a few different styles such as solid, dotted or dashed (among others) <img class="smaller-size-picture"src="https://www.htmldog.com/figures/border-style.png" alt="showing 3 diff borders">
    you can also define the width of borders such as this:
    <div id="thin-border">this border is 10px wide</div>
    <p> an example of code for this is: <div>
      #thin-border{ </div>
        <div>border-width: 10px; </div>
        <div>border-style: solid; } </div>
    </p>
    <div id="thick-border">this border is 20px wide</div>
  </p>
  <h2>What is Padding?</h2>
  <p> Padding is the inner-most space that you are able to manipulate around content/elements. Padding is very similar to the margin with
    the main difference being simply that padding is the innermost space inside the element while the margin is the outermost (refer to picture below).

  <h2>The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</h2>

  alt="Picture illustrating padding, border and margin">
  <p> as shown above, the difference between each is mainly what space in relation to the content you are wanting to affect. With borders
    allowing for stylized and sized differences to suit your needs/wants.
