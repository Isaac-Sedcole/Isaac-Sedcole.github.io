    <p>      
      When I was in university, during my first year one of my courses required us to make a robot that could navigate itself through a maze and we had a strict timeframe of 1 month to complete it.
      We were put into groups of roughly 4 people and were told to get on with it. During the last week there had been a lot of tension built up due to people feeling like there wasn't enough time, 
      that certain people hadn't contributed towards the project fairly/evenly and general high stress period near exams. A strategy I used at this time after being made the team leader was to get everyone
      together to talk through what needed to be done, what we thought we could achieve in the week left, specifically who would be doing what part of the project and setting a schedule that we expected
      everyone to turn up to. This ended up being mostly effective as 3 of the 4 of us were able to stick to what we discussed and got what we needed to done and then the other person sort of flopped under the pressure.
      The downside of making it a reality with the team was that it was too much stress for one of our group members and they decided to withdraw completely. Something I might try to do next time would be
      To talk to everyone individually first to find out everything about what was going on and what they thought was possible for them to do at the time as some people may not be comfortable speaking out in a group enviroment.
      This could of meant that the 4th person didn't feel so overwhelmed and they may have continued on with us.
